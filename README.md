### Login
The login process contains either registering or logging in into an existing account. This is done through file creation, entering a username, password (which is hidden from sight) and a score which is updated throughout the game process. The user's information is stored as an object of the class User and is passed through functions to be updated.

### Rock Paper Scissors

The usual Rock Paper Scissors game based on the input of the user and a random pick from ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]. The program responds according to the regular Rock Paper Scissors rules and adds score to the user's account.

### Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a two player game, played on an output created board. Each player has a turn in which they pick an index to put their mark on. The game is over when one player wins and does not count towards the individual's account. This is done with input validation and replacing elements in the output created board.

### Snake

Snake is played using the WASD on the keyboard. It is one dot(.) that has a tail added every time a fruit(O) is caught. The user can only lose if the head of the snake touches it's tail. When the user is out of bounds, the snake will come out of the other side of the screen.
